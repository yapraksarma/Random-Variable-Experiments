# Random Variable Experiments

This repository contains Python code for conducting experiments with random variables, including the generation of random numbers, calculation of averages and variances, and visualization of results.

## Code Overview

- **Experiment 1**: Generates random variables A, B, and C, and computes the random variable X = A + (B * C). It then calculates the average and variance of X over 30,000 trials.
- **Experiment 2**: Demonstrates two methods for generating random variables:
  - **Part a**: Inverse Transform Method.
  - **Part b**: Rejection Method.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib`).
3. Run the `variable-experiments.py` script:
   ```bash
   python variable-experiments.py
